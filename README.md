## Deep Learning Regression for Car Sales Price Prediction

### Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Deep Learning Regression model using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for predicting car sales prices. The goal of this project is to develop a robust regression model that accurately predicts the prices of cars based on their features.
